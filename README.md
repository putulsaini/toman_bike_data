# toman_bike_data

Our project focused on transforming raw bike data into actionable insights using SQL and Power BI. We delved into various aspects, including total profit and revenue analysis, seasonal revenue trends, and rider demographics. By tracking key performance indicators such as rider engagement and financial performance over time, we uncovered valuable insights. Our analysis highlighted peak sales hours, particularly midday and early evening, with Wednesday and Friday emerging as the most profitable days. We also identified optimal strategies for resource allocation through trend analysis. The culmination of our efforts resulted in an interactive dashboard offering a panoramic view of workforce dynamics, facilitating informed decision-making.
