# toman_bike_data

Our project focused on transforming raw bike data into actionable insights using SQL and Power BI. We delved into various aspects, including total profit and revenue analysis, seasonal revenue trends, and rider demographics. By tracking key performance indicators such as rider engagement and financial performance over time, we uncovered valuable insights. Our analysis highlighted peak sales hours, particularly midday and early evening, with Wednesday and Friday emerging as the most profitable days. We also identified optimal strategies for resource allocation through trend analysis. The culmination of our efforts resulted in an interactive dashboard offering a panoramic view of workforce dynamics, facilitating informed decision-making.

üéØ Project Overview:
Transformed raw bike data from Excel to SQL Server to generate actionable insights. After cleaning the data in Excel, advanced SQL queries (joins, CTEs, union all) were used for transformations. Data was then visualized in Power BI.

üö≤ Problem Statement:
Toman Bike Share aims to determine the feasibility of a price increase next year, requiring a detailed analysis of trends, revenue, profit, seasonal revenue, rider demographics, and productivity obstacles.

üí° Key Highlights:
Data Transformation: Converted raw data into actionable insights using SQL and Power BI.
Insights Unveiled: Analyzed total profit and revenue, seasonal revenue trends, and rider demographics.
KPI Tracking: Evaluated riders in 2021 and 2022, average profit, and revenue to highlight trends.
Hourly Sales Analysis: Higher earnings midday and early evening, with peak sales on Wednesday and Friday.
Trend Analysis: Identified optimal scheduling and resource allocation strategies.
Interactive Dashboard: Created a comprehensive view of workforce dynamics for informed decision-making.
üîç Insights:
Seasonal Revenue: Bike purchases increase daily based on the season, boosting revenue.
Price Change Impact: A 25% price increase from 2021 to 2022 led to a significant revenue jump.
Riders and Profit: Total riders over both years were 3 million, with a profit margin of 0.45 million.
Weekly Profitability: Wednesday and Friday have notably higher sales, indicating variable profitability across the week.
Price-Demand Relationship: Despite a 25% price increase, demand surged by 64%, suggesting further price increases might not harm demand. Price elasticity of 2.56 indicates demand increases significantly with price hikes.
